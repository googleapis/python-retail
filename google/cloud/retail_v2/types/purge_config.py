class PurgeUserEventsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request message for PurgeUserEvents method.

    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. The resource name of the catalog under which the
            events are created. The format is
            ``projects/${projectId}/locations/global/catalogs/${catalogId}``
        filter (str):
            Required. The filter string to specify the events to be
            deleted with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Empty
            string filter is not allowed. The eligible fields for
            filtering are:

            -  ``eventType``: Double quoted
               [UserEvent.event_type][google.cloud.retail.v2.UserEvent.event_type]
               string.
            -  ``eventTime``: in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
            -  ``visitorId``: Double quoted string. Specifying this will
               delete all events associated with a visitor.
            -  ``userId``: Double quoted string. Specifying this will
               delete all events associated with a user.

            Examples:

            -  Deleting all events in a time range:
               ``eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"``
            -  Deleting specific eventType in time range:
               ``eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = "detail-page-view"``
            -  Deleting all events for a specific visitor:
               ``visitorId = "visitor1024"``

            The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
        force (bool):
            Actually perform the purge. If ``force`` is set to false,
            the method will return the expected purge count without
            deleting any user events.
